# Angular Starter

## Getting My Code

Steps:

1. "Say 'Jeff, Can You Push Your Code?'"
2. Dance Party
3. Open a shell in the _root of your project_ and run:

```sh
npx gitpick -o JeffryGonzalez/applied-angular-jul-2025/tree/main/src/frontend instructor
```

This will overwrite whatever was in the `instructor` directory with whatever I just pushed to Github.

Copy and paste stuff from there if you need it.

Don't edit this code unless you want to feel disappointment.

Also, if I `npm install` anything and you didn't, grab my `package.json` and `package-lock.json` too, and run `npm ci` in that directory.
